Hi everyone,

I’ve recently updated my personal website with a cleaner layout and improved structure. I hope the new design makes it easier and more enjoyable to browse.

Going forward, I’ll be regularly sharing:

- **Thoughts on my professional work** such as intelligent manufacturing, AI applications, digital twins, and related topics  
- **Curious and creative finds** including unexpected cultural connections, music experiments, and ideas inspired by daily life

I’ll also be bringing in some older content and organizing it here to build a more complete and personal archive of what I’m working on and thinking about.

Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to check back often or reach out if something catches your interest.

See you around,  
**Wenjin**
