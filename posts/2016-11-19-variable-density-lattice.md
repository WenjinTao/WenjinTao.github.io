The purpose of the work described in the present paper is to establish an efficient approach to model 2D lattice structure with variable density distribution that can be fabricated by AM processes. This approach is flexible enough to be applied to any types of 2D lattice structures.

To realize the flexibility of applying this expected method to any kind of lattice structure, it requires:

* Different kinds of lattice structure should be effectively represented by some general formats or methods.
* Local density of the lattice structure should be effectively represented and easily regulated.
* Because 3D lattice design is the next step of this research, this expected method should have the potential to be easily extended to 3D space.
