Smart manufacturing integrates information, technology, and human ingenuity to inspire the next revolution in the manufacturing industry. Manufacturing has been identified as a key strategic investment area by the U.S. government, private sector, and university leaders to spur innovation and keep America competitive. However, the lack of new methodologies and tools is challenging continuous innovation in the smart manufacturing industry. This award supports fundamental research to develop a cyber-physical sensing, modeling, and control infrastructure, coupled with augmented reality, to significantly improve the efficiency of future workforce training, performance of operations management, safety and comfort of workers for smart manufacturing. Results from this research are expected to transform the practice of worker-machine-task coordination and provide a powerful tool for operations management. This research involves several disciplines including sensing, data analytics, modeling, control, augmented reality, and workforce training and will provide unique interdisciplinary training opportunities for students and future manufacturing engineers.

#### Multi-View Recognition of Complex Hand Gesture

<img src="./assets/img/project_asl_overview.jpg" width="100%" alt="Overview of our proposed approach of multi-view augmentation and inference">

- Considering the challenges of the ASL alphabet recognition task, we choose CNN as the basic model to build the classifier because of its powerful learning ability that has been shown
- To fully exploit the 3D information provided by depth images, we develop a novel multi-view augmentation strategy. It generates more views from different perspectives, in order to augment the perspective variations that cannot be achieved using traditional image augmentation methods 
- To solve the interclass similarity issues caused by perspective variations and partial occlusions, we first make predictions for all individual views and then fuse information from them for the final prediction
- Design and develop a real-time demo of American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet recognition [[demo](https://taowenjin.com/papers/American-sign-language-alphabet-recognition-using-leap-motion-controller.html)] 
- Establish and Publish a dataset of ASL alphabet [[dataset](https://github.com/WenjinTao/ASLA-Leap)]

Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology provides new opportunities to automatically and flexibly fabricate parts with complicated shapes and architectures that could not be produced by conventional manufacturing processes, thus enabling unprecedented design flexibilities and application opportunities. 

The lattice structure possesses many superior properties to solid material and conventional structures. It is able to integrate more than one function into a physical part, which makes it attractive to a wide range of applications. With AM technology the lattice structure can be fabricated by adding material layer-by-layer directly from a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model, rather than the conventional processes with complicated procedures. 

AM lattice structures have been intensively studied for more than ten years with significant progress having been made. This [paper](<https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7790182>) reviews and discusses AM processes, design methods and considerations, mechanical behavior, and applications for lattice structures enabled by this emerging technology.
