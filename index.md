<h3><i class="fas fa-user"></i>Biography</h3>

Wenjin Tao is currently pursuing his PhD degree in the [Innovative Additive Manufacturing Laboratory](http://web.mst.edu/~mstiam/) at [Missouri University of Science and Technology](https://www.mst.edu/), advised by  [Prof. Ming C. Leu](https://web.mst.edu/~mleu/) and co-advised by  [Prof. Zhaozheng Yin](http://web.mst.edu/~yinz/), [Prof. Ruwen Qin](http://web.mst.edu/~qinr/Qin_Ruwen_PhD/Home.html) and [Prof. Zhihai He](https://engineering.missouri.edu/faculty/zhihai-henry-he/).

He is currently focusing on smart manufacturing system boosted by deep learning & artificial intelligence. His research interests include smart manufacturing, Cyber-Physical System (CPS), Additive Manufacturing (AM) and design optimization.

Before he joined Missouri S&T, he received his Master and Bachelor degrees in Mechanical Engineering at [Beijing Inistitute of Technology](http://english.bit.edu.cn/). 

He is a recipient of [2018 IISE DAIS Track Best Paper Award](http://campaign.r20.constantcontact.com/render?m=1101700049774&ca=ed0c3be7-c33d-4f73-9cbe-2269222b73ca). He has been a student member of [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/) and [IISE](http://www.iise.org/Home/). Meanwhile, he is a lifelong learner, DIY enthusiast, and passionate about all kinds of new technology like flying car, self-driving car, etc.

Smart manufacturing integrates information, technology, and human ingenuity to inspire the next revolution in the manufacturing industry. Manufacturing has been identified as a key strategic investment area by the U.S. government, private sector, and university leaders to spur innovation and keep America competitive. However, the lack of new methodologies and tools is challenging continuous innovation in the smart manufacturing industry. This award supports fundamental research to develop a cyber-physical sensing, modeling, and control infrastructure, coupled with augmented reality, to significantly improve the efficiency of future workforce training, performance of operations management, safety and comfort of workers for smart manufacturing. Results from this research are expected to transform the practice of worker-machine-task coordination and provide a powerful tool for operations management. This research involves several disciplines including sensing, data analytics, modeling, control, augmented reality, and workforce training and will provide unique interdisciplinary training opportunities for students and future manufacturing engineers.

This research work is supported by the [National Science
Foundation grant CMMI-1646162](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1646162) and also by the
[Intelligent Systems Center at Missouri University of
Science and Technology](https://isc.mst.edu/).

Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology provides new opportunities to automatically and flexibly fabricate parts with complicated shapes and architectures that could not be produced by conventional manufacturing processes, thus enabling unprecedented design flexibilities and application opportunities. The lattice structure possesses many superior properties to solid material and conventional structures. It is able to integrate more than one function into a physical part, which makes it attractive to a wide range of applications. With AM technology the lattice structure can be fabricated by adding material layer-by-layer directly from a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model, rather than the conventional processes with complicated procedures. AM lattice structures have been intensively studied for more than ten years with significant progress having been made. This paper reviews and discusses AM processes, design methods and considerations, mechanical behavior, and applications for lattice structures enabled by this emerging technology.

#### Self-driving Car

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
